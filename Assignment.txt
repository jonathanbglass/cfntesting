DevSecOps	Assignment
Complete	both	tasks	below.	Provide	evidence	of	implementation	(any	code/scripts	written),
and	a	step-by-step	explanation	of	your	process. Please	also	indicate	the	amount	of	time	spent
on	each	of	the	2	items.

1. Create	a	CloudFormation template	that	will
  create	an	EC2	instance and	all	required dependencies in a	region	
  would	allow	only	Alice	and	Bob	to	modify	or	login	to,	and
  only	from	their	home	IP	addresses.
  Alice’s	IP	is	204.13.56.3	and
  Bob’s	IP	is	176.33.122.64.
  Alice	and	Bob	will	only	be	using	SSH	to	communicate	with	the	host,	and
    the	host	is	only	being	used	for	secure	web	hosting.
a. Template	can	be	submitted	in	JSON	or	YAML	formats.
b. You	may	only	use	SSH to	communicate	with	the	hosts.
c. Any	web	content	being	served	from	hosts	MUST	be secure	content.

2. Create	a	Lambda	function	that	could	be	used	for	compliance	auditing,	and	would
automatically	review	IAM	User	logins	for	corporate	compliance.	Lambda	should	be	able
to	detect	and	automatically	disable	accounts	not	used	or	logged	into for	90	days,	and
delete	accounts	not	used	or	logged	into for	180	days.	Please	use	Java	or	Python	as	your
development	language.
